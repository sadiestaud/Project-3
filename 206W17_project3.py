## SI 206 Winter 2017
## Project 3
## Building on HW6, HW7 (and some previous material!)

## NOTE: There are tests for this project, but the tests are NOT exhaustive -- you should pass them, but ONLY passing them is not necessarily sufficient to get 100% on the project. The caching must work correctly, the queries/manipulations must follow the instructions and work properly. You can ensure they do by testing just the way we always do in class -- try stuff out, print stuff out, use the SQLite DB Browser and see if it looks ok!

## You may turn the project in late as a comment to the project assignment at a deduction of 10 percent of the grade per day late. This is SEPARATE from the late assignment submissions available for your HW.

##### TWEEPY SETUP CODE:
# Authentication information should be in a twitter_info file...
consumer_key = twitter_info.consumer_key
consumer_secret = twitter_info.consumer_secret
access_token = twitter_info.access_token
access_token_secret = twitter_info.access_token_secret
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# Set up library to grab stuff from twitter with your authentication, and return it in a JSON format 
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())

##### END TWEEPY SETUP CODE

## Task 1 - Gathering data

## Define a function called get_user_tweets that gets at least 20 Tweets from a 
# specific Twitter user's timeline, and uses caching. The function should return a 
# Python object representing the data that was retrieved from Twitter. 
# (This may sound familiar...) We have provided a CACHE_FNAME variable for you for the 
# cache file name, but you must write the rest of the code in this file.

# Put the rest of your caching setup here:
CACHE_FNAME = "SI206_project3_cache.json"
try:
	cache_file = open(CACHE_FNAME, 'r')
	cache_contents = cache_file.read()
	cache_file.close()
	CACHE_DICTION = json.loads(cache_contents)
except:
	CACHE_DICTION = {}

# Define your function get_user_tweets here:
def get_user_tweets(twitter_handle):
	if twitter_handle in CACHE_DICTION:
		# print("using cache\n")
		response = CACHE_DICTION[twitter_handle]

	else:
		response = api.user_timeline(twitter_handle)
		CACHE_DICTION[twitter_handle] = response
		# print("fetching\n")
		cache_file = open(CACHE_FNAME, 'w')
		cache_file.write(json.dumps(CACHE_DICTION))
		cache_file.close()

	return response



# Write an invocation to the function for the "umich" user timeline and save the result in a variable called umich_tweets:
umich_tweets = get_user_tweets("umich")
# print(json.dumps(umich_tweets, indent=2))

## Task 2 - Creating database and loading data into database

# You will be creating a database file: project3_tweets.db
# Note that running the tests will actually create this file for you, but will not do anything else to it 
# like create any tables; you should still start it in exactly the same way as if the tests did not do that! 
# The database file should have 2 tables, and each should have the following columns... 
conn = sqlite3.connect("project3_tweets.db")
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tweets")
cur.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Users")

#SQL to create Tweets Table
table_spec = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "
table_spec += "Tweets (tweet_id PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT, user_id TEXT, time_posted INTEGER, retweets INTEGER)"
cur.execute(table_spec)
# table Tweets, with columns:
# - tweet_id (containing the string id belonging to the Tweet itself, from the data you got from Twitter) -- this column should be the PRIMARY KEY of this table
# - text (containing the text of the Tweet)
# - user_posted (an ID string, referencing the Users table, see below)
# - time_posted (the time at which the tweet was created)
# - retweets (containing the integer representing the number of times the tweet has been retweeted)

#SQL to create Users table
table_spec = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "
table_spec += "Users (user_id PRIMARY KEY, screen_name TEXT, num_favs INTEGER, description TEXT)"
cur.execute(table_spec)
# table Users, with columns:
# - user_id (containing the string id belonging to the user, from twitter data) -- this column should be the PRIMARY KEY of this table
# - screen_name (containing the screen name of the user on Twitter)
# - num_favs (containing the number of tweets that user has favorited)
# - description (text containing the description of that user on Twitter, e.g. "Lecturer IV at UMSI focusing on programming" or "I tweet about a lot of things" or "Software engineer, librarian, lover of dogs..." -- whatever it is. OK if an empty string)

## You should load into the Tweets table: 
# Info about all the tweets (at least 20) that you gather from the umich timeline.
# NOTE: Be careful that you have the correct user ID reference in the user_id column! See below hints.
tweet_table = []
for tweet in umich_tweets:
	t = tweet['user']
	tweet_id = tweet['id']

	tup = (tweet_id, text, user_id, time_posted, retweets)
	tweet_table.append(tup)

statement = "INSERT INTO Tweets VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)"
for t in tweet_table:
	cur.execute(statement, t)

conn.commit()

## You should load into the Users table:
# The umich user, and all of the data about users that are mentioned in the umich timeline. 
# NOTE: For example, if the user with the "TedXUM" screen name is mentioned in the umich timeline, that Twitter user's info should be in the Users table, etc.

	return [name[1:] for name in re.findall(r"@\w*", tweet)]

user_table = []

	y = get_twitter_users(x)
	user_table.append(y)

for lst in user_table:
	for name in lst:
		response = api.get_user(name)
		user_names.append(response)

d = abc['description']
tup = (a,b,c,d)
user_table.append(tup)

for user in user_names:
	user_id = user['id_str']
	screen_name = user['screen_name']
	num_favs = user['favourites_count']
	description = user['description']
	tup = (user_id, screen_name, num_favs, description)

		user_table.append(tup)
# print(user_table)

statement = "INSERT INTO Users VALUES (?,?,?,?)"
for user in user_table:
	cur.execute(statement, user)
conn.commit()

## Task 3 - Making queries, saving data, fetching data

# All of the following sub-tasks require writing SQL statements and executing them using Python.

# Make a query to select all of the records in the Users database. Save the list of tuples in a variable called users_info.
x = "SELECT * FROM Users"
cur.execute(x)
users_info = cur.fetchall()
# Make a query to select all of the user screen names from the database. 
# Save a resulting list of strings (NOT tuples, the strings inside them!) 
# in the variable screen_names. HINT: a list comprehension will make this easier to complete!
x = "SELECT screen_name FROM Users"
cur.execute(x)
y = cur.fetchall()
screen_names = []
for tup in y:
	for name in tup:
		screen_names.append(name)

# Make a query to select all of the tweets (full rows of tweet information) that have been retweeted more than 25 times. 
# Save the result (a list of tuples, or an empty list) in a variable called more_than_25_rts.
x = "SELECT * FROM Tweets WHERE retweets > 25"
cur.execute(x)
more_than_25_rts = cur.fetchall()

# Make a query to select all the descriptions (descriptions only) of the users who have favorited more than 25 tweets. 
# Access all those strings, and save them in a variable called descriptions_fav_users, which should ultimately be a list of strings.
x = "SELECT description FROM Users WHERE num_favs > 25"
cur.execute(x)
y = cur.fetchall()
descriptions_fav_users = []
for tup in y:
	for des in tup:
		descriptions_fav_users.append(des)


# Make a query using an INNER JOIN to get a list of tuples with 2 elements in each 
# tuple: the user screenname and the text of the tweet -- for each tweet that has been retweeted more than 50 times. 
# Save the resulting list of tuples in a variable called joined_result.
x = "SELECT Users.screen_name, Tweets.text FROM Users INNER JOIN Tweets on Tweets.user_id=Users.user_id WHERE Tweets.retweets > 50"
cur.execute(x)
joined_result = cur.fetchall()

## Task 4 - Manipulating data with comprehensions & libraries

## Use a set comprehension to get a set of all words (combinations of characters separated by whitespace) 
# among the descriptions in the descriptions_fav_users list. Save the resulting set in a variable called 
# description_words.


description_words = {word for string in descriptions_fav_users for word in string.split()}

## Use a Counter in the collections library to find the most common character among all of the descriptions 
# in the descriptions_fav_users list. Save that most common character in a variable called most_common_char. 
# Break any tie alphabetically (but using a Counter will do a lot of work for you...).
x = collections.Counter()
for des in descriptions_fav_users:
	for word in des:
		x.update(word)
most_common_char = x.most_common(1)[0][0]


## Putting it all together...
# Write code to create a dictionary whose keys are Twitter screen names and whose associated values are lists 
# of tweet texts that that user posted. You may need to make additional queries to your database! To do this, 
# you can use, and must use at least one of: the DefaultDict container in the collections library, a dictionary 
# comprehension, list comprehension(s).
# You should save the final dictionary in a variable called twitter_info_diction.
x = "SELECT Users.screen_name, Tweets.text FROM Users INNER JOIN Tweets on Tweets.user_id=Users.user_id"
cur.execute(x)
tweet_tup = cur.fetchall()

diction = collections.defaultdict(list)
for k,v in tweet_tup:
	diction[k].append(v)
twitter_info_diction = dict(diction)
print(twitter_info_diction)
